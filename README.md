# learning-react

First of all, install node.js to use npm.
After that, do:
> npm install -g create-react-app (-g stands for globally) 

Read this for more info:

After installing, do:
> create-react-app my-app
> cd my-app
> npm start

To send requests, use fetch https://github.com/github/fetch

I also used react-router: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router
> npm install --save react-router
